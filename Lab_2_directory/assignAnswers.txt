Assignment 1

1. The segmentation fault was caused by the line:
   scanf("%d", input);

2. The fix is:
   scanf("%d", &input);

3. The bug is that sum was passed by value, so changes made in
   read_values did not affect the sum variable in main.

4. The fix is to pass the address of sum (double *sum) and use
   *sum inside the function to update it.

Assignment 2

1. When I entered “HELLO!” and “hello!”, the output was correct and printed “HELLO!hello!”.

2. When I entered “HI!” and “hi!” without stopping the program, the output was incorrect because the append function did not add a null terminator ('\0'). 
This caused leftover characters to appear. The fix is to add s1[s1len + s2len] = '\0'; after the loop.

3. When I entered longer strings like “Hello! How are you?” and “I am fine, thank you!”, the output was incorrect 
because str1 and str2 are only size 10, causing buffer overflow and undefined behavior.
