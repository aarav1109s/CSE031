1. Name the 3 pools for memory and what kind of variables are stored in each pool.

There are three main memory pools in C:

    Stack
    Stores local variables
    Stores function parameters
    Automatically managed (created when function starts, destroyed when it ends)

2. Heap

    Stores dynamically allocated memory

    Allocated using malloc(), calloc(), or realloc()

    Must be manually freed using free()

3. Data Segment

    Stores global variables

    Stores static variables

    Stores string literals

    Exists for the entire lifetime of the program

2. mem.c Analysis

a. How many variables are declared?

    Three variables are declared in main:

    int num

    int *ptr

    int **handle

    Additionally, two blocks of memory are allocated dynamically using malloc().

b. How many of them are pointers? What type does each pointer point to?

    There are two pointer variables:

    ptr → pointer to int

    handle → pointer to pointer to int

    ptr points to dynamically allocated integer memory.
    handle points to dynamically allocated memory that stores a pointer to int.

c. Which pool of memory are these variables stored in?

    num → Stack

    ptr → Stack

    handle → Stack

    Memory allocated using malloc() → Heap

d. Which pool of memory will pointer ptr point to?

    ptr points to memory allocated using malloc(), which is stored in the Heap.

3. Memory Layout Explanation

Stack:

    num (stores 14)

    ptr (stores address of heap memory)

    handle (stores address of heap memory that stores ptr)

Heap:

    First allocation: stores integer value copied from num

    Second allocation: stores the value of ptr (an address)

Pointer Relationships:

    ptr points to heap memory containing an integer.

    handle points to heap memory containing the address stored in ptr.

    *handle equals ptr.

    **handle equals the integer value stored in heap (same as num).

TPS 2

1. What does NodeStruct.c do?

    The program dynamically allocates memory for a struct Node on the Heap.

    The struct contains:

    int iValue

    float fValue

    struct Node *next

    The program:

    Allocates memory for one Node

    Assigns values to iValue and fValue

    Leaves next uninitialized unless explicitly set

2. Printing Values and Addresses

    The following were printed:

    Value of head

    Address of head

    Value and address of iValue

    Value and address of fValue

    Value and address of next

    Observations:

    head is stored on the Stack.

    The Node structure is stored on the Heap.

    The structure members are stored contiguously in memory.

    The addresses of iValue, fValue, and next are sequential (possibly with padding).

3. Observations About Structure Storage

    Structures are stored as a single block of contiguous memory.

    The pointer head is stored on the Stack.

    The actual struct Node is stored on the Heap.

    head contains the address of the structure in Heap memory.

    Using head->member accesses memory inside the allocated structure.

    The relationship between head and the Node structure:

    head holds the starting address of the structure.

    The structure members are accessed relative to that address.
