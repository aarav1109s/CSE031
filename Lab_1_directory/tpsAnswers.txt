TPS2:

1. How can you open a terminal from your Linux/Mac/Windows computer?
    You can open a terminal in Windows using Windows key + R and searching "cmd".
a. Can you open more than 1 terminal at the same time?
    Yes you can.
b. Why do you think you want to open more than 1 terminal at the same time?
    So you can run, test, and debug code all at the same time.

2. In the terminal, how can you tell what are contents inside the current directory (i.e., what is the command)?
    By typing the command "ls".

3. From your current directory, how can you navigate to Desktop directory?
    First go to the terminal and type "cd Lab_1 directory"

4. While you are in Desktop, create a new directory called CSE31. How do you do this?
    By typing "mkdir CSE31" in the terminal.

TPS 3:

1. Independently find 2 online references on how to use GCC in a Linux/Mac/PowerShell terminal.

2. Share what you have found with your partners and save your results in the bookmark of your browser.
You will refer to these references to answer the following questions.
3. What command do you type in the terminal to compile your main.c?
    You type "gcc main.c -o main".
4. How do you know if your program has compiled successfully?
    If there are no errors and produces an executeable file.
5. What does the –c flag do in gcc?
    Tells the compiler to compile the source file into an object file without linking, producing a .o file instead of an executable.
6. What does the –g flag do in gcc?
    It debugs information in the compiled program so it can be used with a debugger like gdb.
7. How do you change the executable name from main to cselab1?
    By typing a command such as this "gcc main.c -o cselab1"
8. What happens when you compile your code by typing gcc main.c only?
    GCC compiles and links the program successfully but creates an executable with the default name a.out.
9. Now, let us run the program you have just compiled. What command do you use?
    You run the program using "./a.out".
